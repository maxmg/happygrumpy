# HappyGrumpy

HappyGrumpy is an application for businesses that want to understand the mood of their coworkers.
It helps coworkers share instant feelings about professional situations. Managers can then analyze anonymized trends to detect emotion intensity, incoming conflicts, and improve overall efficiency and communication.

Coworkers share emotions only with their trusted coworkers. This allows them to express and compare their feelings privately and comfortably. Often, simply sharing emotions is already half the solution to frustration.

While instant emotions are shared privately, this approach enables objectivity through third-party perspectives and enhances workplace harmony.

Privacy matters: shared messages remain private between sender and recipients. Managers can consult the emotions-map to detect where strong feelings occur.

## Why HappyGrumpy Works Better

The organization already provides a NikoNiko for coworkers, but nobody uses it. Why would HappyGrumpy work better?

Let's be honest: NikoNiko is no fun for coworkers to use. You need a good level of UX with fun and interaction so that your coworkers are willing to express their emotions daily through a tool. You need a tool that coworkers want for themselves first, not a tool wanted by managers. This is why HappyGrumpy works: people are delighted to use the app, thanks to enhanced AI visuals, emotion cookbooks, and nice interactions within the app.
